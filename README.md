# Password-Manager and strength-predictor app
# Strength predictor using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
The app is built using tkinter and acts as a simple password manager, which stores data in a database using sqlite.
The app involves a "Check Password Strength" option to check the strength of the passwords belonging to that of the user using NLP and Deep learning.


Traditional password strength checkers rely on pattern recognition and regex expressions, this involves a novel way of checking strength by training a neural network(LSTM) to learn to predict the strength of passwords.
The notebook file is present in the strength_predictor folder and further information is explained.
